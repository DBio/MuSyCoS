open-source 2014, licensed as GNU GPL v3

Requirements:
	MVC November 2013, possibly GCC v4.9.0 or newer
	Gecode constraint solver (http://www.gecode.org/)
	Boost headers version 1.47 or newer. (http://www.boost.org/)
	Google test library for the test project (https://code.google.com/p/googletest/)

Building:
	generator.cpp:
		compile for the generator of random .pasn models
		link with boost-filesystem, boost-program_options
	main.cpp
		compile for the MuSyCoS tool
		link with: gecode-kernel, gecode-int, gecode-minimodel, boost-filesystem, boost-program_options
	test.cpp
		compile for the tests of MuSyCoS
		link with: gecode-kernel, gecode-int, gecode-minimodel, google-test, google-test-main
	
Execution:
	generator.cpp k j l [-svh]
		m: number of species in the model
		j: number of regulators per specie
		l: size of the domain (each specie can attain value from the set {0,..,j-1})
		
	main file.pasn [-svh]
		file.pasn: input mode file in the .pasn format
		s: compute steady statates, for "file.pasn" these are written to the "file_stable.csv"
		
Pasn format:
	example: A'=B{0,3}+A{1}*B{2} is a 4-valued model
	where B{0,3} takes value 4 iff (B==0 or B==3) and 0 otherwise
	+ is max
	* is min
